What is this python file?

This represent as my personalized data which is my personal interest.
I like to play Video Games a lot, which is why This API allows you to see
what video games won the "Game of the Year Award" and its details from 2014-2022 (Game of the year Award for 2023 has not yet been decided),
I created an API which has Get option that allows you to see the details of the listed video games and what year does this specific game won.

How to use this API?

Just open post man and run flask, copy the running http given and paste it in Postman.
Params:
- Key 'name' and value 'game title'
